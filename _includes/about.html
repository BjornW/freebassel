<p>#FREEBASSEL is a campaign to bring about the safe and immediate release of Bassel Khartabil from wrongful detainment in Syria since March 2012. He is a well known contributor to global software and culture communities like <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>, <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla Firefox</a>, <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://openclipart.org">Open Clip Art Library</a>, <a href="http://fabricatorz.com">Fabricatorz</a>, and <a href="http://sharism.org">Sharism</a>.
