<p>A campaign has been launched to demand the freedom of Syrian software Bassel Khartabil, who was detained without trial by the Syrian government for four months.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://freebassel.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://freebassel.org/']);">#FreeBassel initiative</a> is also petitioning for immediate information regarding his detention, health, and psychological state.</p>
<p>Bassel is known for his commitment to the open web, volunteering for major internet projects like the Creative Commons, Mozilla Firefox, and Wikipedia.<span id="more-39927"></span></p>
<p>He had also spent a couple of weeks in Singapore in 2010 to work on a project and hung out frequently at <a href="http://hackerspace.sg/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://hackerspace.sg/']);">Hackerspace Singapore</a>, which was still in its early days then.</p>
<p>Bassel was detained on 15th March 2012 in the Mazzeh district of Damascus as part of a wave of arrests. Since then, his volunteer work has ceased, affecting the communities that depend on him.</p>
<p>He was supposed to marry his fianc√©e in April.</p>
<p>Readers who want to sign the petition can do so <a href="http://freebassel.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://freebassel.org/']);">here</a>.</p>
