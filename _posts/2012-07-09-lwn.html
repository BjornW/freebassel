Mitchell Baker has written a <a href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2012/07/05/contributor-imprisoned-in-syria/">blog post</a> expressing Mozilla's support for the Internet-based campaign on behalf of Bassel Khartabil, an open source developer who has been detained in Syria.  "<span>Mozilla supports efforts to obtain the release of Bassel Khartabil (also known as Bassel Safadi), a valuable contributor to and leader in the technology community. Basselâ€™s expertise and focus across all aspects of his work has been in support of the development of publicly available, free, open source computer software code and technology.</span>"  In addition to Mozilla work, Khartabil has contributed to Creative Commons, Open Clip Art Library, and several other projects. The campaign centers on a petition and letter-writing drive at <a href="http://freebassel.org/">freebassel.org</a>.</p>
